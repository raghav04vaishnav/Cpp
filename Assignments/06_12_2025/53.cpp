Take a single character as input and print its Ascii value.
Ans :- #include <bits/stdc++.h>
        using namespace std;

        int main() {
        char ch;
        cout << "Enter a character: ";
        cin >> ch;
        cout << "The ASCII value of " << ch << " is " << int(ch) << '\n';
        return 0;
       }
