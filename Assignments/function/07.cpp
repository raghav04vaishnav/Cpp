Write a function displayRules() that prints any 3 app/game rules.

Ans:- #include<bits/stdc++.h>
       using namespace std;
       void displayRules()
   {
         cout<<"Do not share your personal information.\n";
         cout<<"Follow all community guidelines while playing.\n";
         cout<<"Report any bugs or issues to the support team\n";

}
  int main()
{
	displayRules();
}

Output:- Do not share your personal information.
Follow all community guidelines while playing.
Report any bugs or issues to the support team.
